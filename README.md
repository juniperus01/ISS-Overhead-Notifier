ISS Tracker using Python and API

International Space Station (ISS) floats high above in the sky and it circles Earth many many times a day. Using technology known as APIs and modules like requests and smtplib from Python library, I have created this ISS Tracker.This keeps a track where the ISS is currently at in the sky. And at the time point, when the ISS is in the night sky, right abovethe location where we are, then this program is  going to send an email telling us to look up and spot the fast-moving ISS.
